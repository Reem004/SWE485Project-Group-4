**Project Title:** Salama

**Project Motivation:**
Modern healthcare systems face significant challenges associated with early disease detection. Many individuals experience multiple,  ambiguous, symptoms but lack the medical expertise to interpret them correctly.

Developing an  medical advice system that predicts diseases from patient-reported symptoms can mitigate these challenges. 

The chosen dataset is suitable because it provides a comprehensive, structured, and balanced view of symptom-disease relationships. The dataset allows for training a high-capacity machine learning model capable of identifying patterns across a spectrum of conditions.
